    <h3>Homemade Sushi is so much cheaper than at the restaurant. Plus, it's easy<br> and fun to make at home, and you can put all your favorite ingredients into<br> your perfect custom roll — here's how!
    </h3>
    <p>I'll be very honest and say that there's definitely a reason why chefs spend a decade learning<br> how to perfect sushi rice or cut raw fish like a boss, because it does make a difference.
    </p>
    <p>Homemade sushi will never be at the level of what you'd get from the top sushi restaurants in<br> NYC, but here's where homemade sushi wins:
    </p>
    <p>You get to gorge yourself on a FEAST for like $20, whereas a similar amount of sushi at a<br> restaurant would cost a couple hundred. Soooooo worth it, if you ask me. And you know what<br> else? Sushi is really fun to make at home.

    <!--Steps-->
    <h3>How to Make Sushi:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li><br>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and<br> simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes..</li><br>
        <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and<br> set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li><br>
        <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top.<br> Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down<br> the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat<br> with remaining ingredients.</li><br>
        <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
        <p><b>Tips:</b> If you do not have a bamboo sushi mat, the easiest way to roll sushi is with a clean dish towel.</p>
