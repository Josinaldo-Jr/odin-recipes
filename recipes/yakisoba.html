    <h3>Yakisoba is a classic Japanese noodle dish with a salty, sweet and sour sauce. <br>
        Made in one-pan, this recipe is so easy to make and is always a crowd pleaser.
    </h3>
    <p>Yakisoba noodles have become quite the staple in our home. We love ordering takeout just like <br> the next
        family, but this recipe is so quick we can whip it up before a delivery order could even arrive.
    </p>
    <p>These noodles are made with chicken, but if you are craving beef try making Beef Yakisoba instead. <br> Also,
        feel free to omit the chicken or beef if you are a vegetarian! The noodles are just as delicious <br> meatless
        or tossed with some grilled tofu instead.
