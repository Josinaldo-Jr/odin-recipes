    <!--Ingredients List-->
    <h3>Ingredients for Pizza Crust:</h3>
    <p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple pizza crust.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Yeast</b> - Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes<br> the
            pizza dough to rise.</li><br>
        <li><b>Sugar</b> - To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon<br> of
            sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process.<br> You'll know your
            yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</li><br>
        <li><b>Bread Flour</b> - Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust because it creates chewier results than<br>
            all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten.<br> Gluten
            is what gives the crust elasticity.</li><br>
        <li><b>Olive Oil</b> - Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it<br> add
            color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents<br>
            sogginess.</li><br>
        <li><b>Salt</b> - A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a<br>
            chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li><br>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Make Pizza Crust:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan.</li><br>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about<br> 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand<br> or use a stand
            mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle. Transfer<br> to the
            prepared pizza pan.</li><br>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li><br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven<br> and let cool for 5
            minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
    <p>You can use all-purpose flour, but the bread flour makes a superior crust.

        If you have a pizza<br> stone, dust it with cornmeal and use it instead of a greased pizza pan.</p>
