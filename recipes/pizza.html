    <!--Ingredients List-->
    <h3>Ingredients for Pizza Crust:</h3>
    <p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple pizza crust.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Yeast</b> - Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes<br> the pizza dough to rise.</li><br>
        <li><b>Sugar</b> - To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon<br> of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process.<br> You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</li><br>
        <li><b>Bread Flour</b> - Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust because it creates chewier results than<br> all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten.<br> Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</li><br>
        <li><b>Olive Oil</b> - Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it<br> add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents<br> sogginess.</li><br>
        <li><b>Salt</b> - A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a<br> chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li><br>
    </ul>
